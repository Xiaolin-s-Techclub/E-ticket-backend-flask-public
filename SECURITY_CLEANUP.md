# Security Cleanup Report

This repository has been cleaned of sensitive data to prepare for public release.

## 🔒 Security Issues Removed

### 1. Credentials and API Keys
- ✅ Removed `.env` file containing AWS credentials, database passwords, and API keys
- ✅ Deleted entire `creds/` directory with Google OAuth credentials and tokens
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded database connection strings with environment variables

### 2. Personal Information
- ✅ Replaced real email addresses (`xiaolinstechclub@gmail.com`, student emails) with examples
- ✅ Changed test data from real student information to generic examples
- ✅ Updated names in test data (KOBAYASHI SOTA → DOE JOHN)
- ✅ Replaced student IDs with example numbers

### 3. Production Infrastructure
- ✅ Replaced production URLs (`https://mis.xiaolinstechclub.com/`) with placeholders
- ✅ Removed DigitalOcean database hostnames
- ✅ Made server URLs configurable via environment variables

### 4. Configuration Security
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent future credential commits
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template for configuration
- ✅ Updated configuration files to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your actual values
2. **Database**: Update all database connection strings with your own credentials
3. **Email Services**: Configure your own AWS SES and Waypoint API credentials
4. **Domain**: Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain
5. **Secrets**: Generate new secrets and keys - don't reuse any from the original repository

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Applied

- All sensitive data moved to environment variables
- Comprehensive gitignore prevents future leaks
- Example configuration provides clear setup guidance
- Production URLs made configurable
- Test data anonymized

The repository is now safe for public release. Make sure to configure your own credentials before deployment.
